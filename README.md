Hey! I'm [Marwan Tamer](https://marwantamer.netlify.app/). I'm an Information System undergraduate at [Cairo University](https://cu.edu.eg/Home).

I'm fascinated by technology and how it improves out daily lives and how collaboration between developers can create such massive systems that benefits everyone!

I started learning about programming in highschool, mainly focusing on competitive programming and basic problem solving skills in c++, I enrolled in [Million Arab Coders initiative](https://www.udacity.com/mena/one-million-arab-coders/en) and finished the Android App development Courses to learn more about how apps are developed.

Throughout college I started to focus on Web Development, enrolling in multiple Web Related courses from from Udacity provided by [FWD](https://egfwd.com/) and started creating personal projects to enhance my skills in React.js, TailwindCSS, Node.js, and MongoDB (MERN techstack).
You can Find my [Portfolio](https://marwantamer.netlify.app/) here and my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ny2NWh79BNSot29rlo0teJ_Q_Kyk7nej/view?usp=sharing) here!

Lastly, I want to keep learning and advancing to start creating systems and technologies that help people's everywhere on our planet!
